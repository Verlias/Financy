                In addition to promoting economic expansion, banks ensure financial stability through their role in the payment system, risk management, and liquidity provision. They facilitate transactions between individuals, businesses, and institutions, maintaining the smooth flow of money and economic activity. Banks also offer financial products that help manage risks and provide liquidity when needed, contributing to overall stability. Central banks regulate banks and implement monetary policy to maintain price stability and economic growth, further enhancing financial stability and confidence in the system.
