                Socially responsible investing (SRI) involves investing in companies or funds that have positive social impacts, reflecting a growing trend towards conscious capitalism. Investors may opt for SRI by selecting companies engaged in social justice, environmental sustainability, or clean technology efforts. This approach often avoids investments in industries like alcohol, tobacco, or gambling, instead favoring those with a commitment to social responsibility and ethical practices.

                Impact investing takes SRI a step further by actively seeking investments that generate positive social or environmental impacts alongside financial returns. It involves considering a company's commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) or its ability to serve society positively. Impact investments can range from supporting nonprofits benefiting communities to investing in sustainable energy practices. These investments are driven by a desire to make a tangible difference while earning returns, and they are increasingly popular among investors, especially younger generations like millennials and Gen Z.
                </p>
                <p>Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors play a crucial role in impact investing, guiding investors towards companies with ethical governance, worker well-being, and sustainable business practices. While ESG integration aims to enhance financial analysis, socially responsible investing (SRI) goes beyond, actively selecting or eliminating investments based on specific ethical guidelines. Both approaches contribute to impact investing, with SRI often focusing on avoidance of harm while impact investing aims for positive outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>Impact-focused investing is exemplified by institutions like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Soros Economic Development Fund, and the Ford Foundation, which allocate resources towards ventures aligned with their mission to drive positive change. Despite a slight discrepancy in returns compared to non-impact-seeking funds, impact investing continues to attract investors seeking both financial and social/environmental returns, underscoring its significance in promoting socially conscious practices within the investment landscape.</p>
