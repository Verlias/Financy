## Why?

We created Financy to address the crucial gap in education: the lack of practical financial knowledge and skills. We want to support the younger generation in navigating the complexities of money matters, and ensuring they have the right knowledge and tools to make smart financial decisions from the present day, to their transition to college, and far beyond. Adolescence marks a pivotal time, and while traditional educational curricula offer valuable insights, we recognize that the complex landscape of personal finance requires ongoing learning beyond the classroom. Our website serves as a great resource and opportunity for young minds, providing practical and interactive tools designed to reinforce and expand upon the financial concepts introduced in schools. By offering engaging modules, real-world examples, and interactive activities, we aim to empower adolescents to build upon their foundational knowledge and develop essential financial skills that will prove beneficial for their future.
